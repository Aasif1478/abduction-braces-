# Smart Abduction Brace for Congenital Clubfoot

## 📌 Introduction
Congenital clubfoot (Talipes Equinovarus) is a birth deformity in which the foot
twists inward and downward. If untreated, it leads to severe mobility limitations
and lifelong disability. The standard treatment is the Ponseti method, involving
serial casting followed by prolonged use of an abduction brace.

Despite successful initial correction, relapse remains common due to poor brace
compliance caused by discomfort, rigidity, and lack of monitoring.

## 🎯 Aim
To design and develop a mechanical abduction brace for congenital clubfoot using
a gear-based angle adjustment mechanism and a lightweight metal connecting bar,
with an optional smart monitoring system to improve comfort, compliance, and
treatment outcomes.

## ✅ Objectives
- Incorporate a gear-based mechanism for precise angle adjustment
- Redesign the connecting bar using lightweight materials
- Improve ergonomics and infant comfort
- Enhance brace compliance and reduce relapse risk
- Explore sensor-based monitoring for wear-time and pressure

## 🦶 Clinical Background
Clubfoot presents with:
- Forefoot adduction
- Hindfoot varus
- Ankle equinus
- Midfoot cavus

Post-correction bracing is critical for maintaining alignment and preventing relapse.

## ⚙️ Mechanical Design
- **Gear mechanism** enables controlled abduction (60–70° affected foot,
  40–45° unaffected foot) and dorsiflexion (10–15°)
- **Lightweight aluminum or stainless steel connecting rod**
- EVA foam padding for comfort
- Adjustable orthotic shoes with quick-release fasteners

## 🧠 Smart Monitoring System (Optional)
To address compliance issues, sensors are integrated into the brace:
- Heel, forefoot, midfoot, strap tension, and lateral pressure sensors
- IMU for motion detection
- Temperature and humidity sensor for comfort monitoring
- ESP32 microcontroller with BLE/WiFi
- Data transmitted to mobile app and clinician dashboard

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- CAD: Fusion 360 / SolidWorks
- Manufacturing: 3D printing, machining
- Electronics: ESP32, FSR sensors, IMU, environmental sensors
- Power: LiPo battery with charging and protection module

## 📊 Expected Outcomes
- Accurate mechanical angle control
- Improved comfort and ease of use
- Objective monitoring of wear-time and fitting quality
- Better compliance leading to reduced relapse rates
- Low-cost, locally manufacturable design

## 📁 Documentation
- Project presentation
- Smart brace system design document
- Block diagrams, workflow, and design files
